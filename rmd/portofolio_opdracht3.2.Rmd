Where do I want to be in ~2 years time?

I still have multiple things I wanna try. These include:

- working in an ecological lab 

- clinical lab work (like labratory work in a hospital)

- possibly something with organoids 

Because I still have many intrests, and I now can't properly estimate where I see myself go the coming few years, I'd like to take a more general approach and get a wider few of what's all still possible with bioinformatics. This would help me to more easily adept, and learn specific skills later when I've more clear what I want to do. 


How am I doing now with respect to this goal?

I didnt get started yet 

What would be the next skill to learn?

In order to get this wider few, I'd like to to learn to code with python. By knowing this programming language I could later on more easily adept and advance. To do this, I will, between 09-05-2022 and 06-06-2022 spend 1 hour every week (moday till friday) day and 2 hours every day in the weekend (saturday and sunday) on learning about python.
