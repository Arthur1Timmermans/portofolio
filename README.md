# portofolio
Welcome,  this is my main directory from which a book can build with the bookdown function. If this is the first time opening this repository, run all script in the folder "r", to install all required packages and activate all needed libraries for all other analysis's. After that, the book can be build with the "build book" function from bookdown. 

To make the rendered book more tidy, a lot of the code is hidden. For those who want to take a closer look at all the code and data files used, down bellow a list is provided of everything available in the main folder. Note that all sub folders have their own readme files describing what is in the folder and for which bookdown chapter each file in the folder is used. 

The following folders are available:   
- a folder for all finished html files (html) 
- a folder for all used r scripts (r)
- a folder for all raw data (raw)
- a folder for all edited data files (data)
- a folder for all used images (images)
- a folder for all figures rendered by bookdown (_bookdown_files)
- a folder for all HTML files rendered by bookdown (_book)

Further more, this main directory contains: 
- a git ignore file
- all used RMD files for my bookdown project 
- a bibliography.bib file to create a bibliography 
- an index.rmd file which creates the yamal header and thus, set the settings for my bookdown project 
- a r project file
