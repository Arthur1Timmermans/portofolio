In this chapter, I will make a paramererized report of the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) COVID-19 case data. This data is available at the ECDC website. The aim of this analysis is to create 3 graphs, in which the amount of infections (new cases) and deaths will be mapped by the following params: The country to which the report applies to The year that the reported data applies to The period in months that the report applies to At first, I mapped the new cases, which can be seen in plot 1.

Within this plot, a line somewhat similar to the covid19 cases (plot 1) can be seen. To further visualize this, plot 1 and 2 are also combined using the plot_grind function. This created plot 3, in which a clear connection between the 2 plots can be seen. plot2, covid19 deaths in Austria in 2021 plot3, covid19 cases and deaths in Austria in 2021 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
